# Python advance track

####Track description
The goal of the track is to get you confortable with python at the same time solving interesting problems and eventually training someone else. The track will be divided into several proposed sections each spanning a few weeks. The structure is adoptedfrom the existing python koans open source project.  

The sections are 
* Python language. This will cover most things about python as a language. In a nutshell this will cover most concepts from
the basics syntax to OOP concepts to how you can utilize different modules in python.
* Automating the boring stuff. This will be activities that automate something on your machine.  
* Databases and create a simple web based system with python using one of python's web framworks. 
* Solve a problem in Tunapanda with the skills aquired so far.
* Contribute to an open source project most preferably one that is not Tunapanda's.
* Teach others taking the next session of the advance tracks.

###Installing Python Advanced Track
Aside from downloading or checking out the latest version of Python-advance-tracks, you need to install the Python interpreter.

The Python version in use id Python 2.7

###Getting started

You first have to install python advanced track and python on your local machine. Then via the terminal, navigate to the Python advanced track directory(on listing, contemplate.py should be visible). Contemplate.py is the entry file and on running it, instructions of existing first problem set should be displayed. The solution to the problem set gpes to the koan_labs folder and specifioc problem set file with a .py extension. 

To create your own or add to the existing probem sets, enter the problem description and the test cases in a new .py file in the koans folder. Create a new related .py file in the koan_labs folder and enter the necessary source code. Import the about file in the koans folder to the path_to_enlightenment.py file in the runner folder. Test for bugs in your problem set and make a pull request if it works.

####Learning materials 
For the first section of the advance track, there are tones of resources in the internet for that and for most lessons, a link to recommended resources will be provided. Swagpaths for the first section might/will be created as well. 
For the other sections, research (and may be posting question on forums like stackoverflow) will be the main way of getting information.

####Activities and exercises.
The advance track will have a lot exercises and projects. The track will be based on the agile development methodology with TDD at the heart of most, if not all projects. Team work will be encouraged where teams actively utilizing github as the main tool of collaboration.
