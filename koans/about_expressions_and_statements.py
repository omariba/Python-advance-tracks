            ACTIVITY
            ========
            Open koan_labs/expressions_and_statements.py. Inside the compounded_principle function, create a variable that 
            stores a principal amount of 10000. The interest is compounded once a year at a rate of 8% (0.08). Given the 
            time (as an argument) that the money will be compounded for, calculate and print the final amount when 
            the time expires.
    			A = P (1 + (r/n)) ^ nt

    			Where:
    			P = Principal amount
    			r = annual nominal interest rate
    			n = number of times the interest in compunded per year
    			t = number of years
                """
